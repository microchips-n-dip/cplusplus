        , making it physically the largest country ever founded by
        humans. Because it is so distant from any other country, it is unique
        in not sharing a border with any neighbor. The mean surface temperature
        the planet is -63&#8451; and the atmosphere is composed of 98%

        making it extremely inhospitable to humans, and consequently
        inducing a low population on the order of twelve million people and 
        necessarily total urbanization.

        <!--BRIEF HISTORY-->
        The Martian society has been described as "melting together"; arising
        from the cooperation of various space and engineering organizations,
        the government being formed initially to handle logistics between these
        groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!--BRIEF GOVERNMENT-->
        Martians have a representative democratic system which has been optimized
        to ensure the wellfare of the citizens. It relies on electing representatives
        locally in districts rather than voting for a national party, president or
        prime minister. There is no head of state, opting for a dynamic parliament
        devoid of parties to minimize partisan polarization and allowing a relatively
        continuous government commitment. While in other party-based democracies, where
        as new parties are elected they tend to work against each other, the Martian
        system reflects the long-term commitment of the citizens. The prevalent
        preference for truth and verifiability has lead to policies requiring the
        accurate representation as either theory or belief, which has been criticized
        as limiting free speech, but the government maintains the regulation does
        not work against free speech, but does require the prefacing of ideas to
        avoid misrepresentation.

        The crew consisted of the pilot, Timothy Peake; engineers, Samantha
        Christoforetti and Andreas Morgensen; biologist, Maria Rossi; and geologist,
        Gwynn Williams. They landed at the most south-eastern extemity of the
        Valles Marineris. Several supply packages, such as the habitation module,
        one month of rations for the whole crew, a dozen photovoltaic cells,
        a rover, and the orbital return module, had already been sent to the
        surface prior to their arrival. The site is now a popular historic
        destination, much of the original equipment still functioning.

        studying everything from Martian geology to human gene sequencing to
        cell division with prolonged exposure to the low gravity of Mars.
        The facility was unfortunately destroyed in the year 2053 due to the impact of
        a small meteorite, which was believed to be striking several kilometers away,
        directly onto the hub module, killing the five crew inside, making them the
        first humans to die on the surface of another planet. Fortunately the other
        seven crew members were clear of the impact and were able to salvage the
        return vehicle and get back to Earth safely.

        Permenant colonies on Mars were established by three major organizations.
        The European Space Agency performed the
        <a href="#First_ESA_mission" class="mw-redirect"
        title="First_ESA_mission">first manned mission to Mars</a>
        and primarily concentrated their efforts to the region of Noachia
        in the far-southern hemisphere of the planet. The
        <a href="wiki_nacmc.html" class="mw-redirect"
        title="NACMC">NACMC</a>
        constructed a large facility at the base of Olympus Mons, with
        the necessary utilities for constructing new rocketry and refining
        fuel. Perhaps most instrumental to providing the infrastructure for
        which necessitated the establishment of the first government, the
        <a href="wiki_oec.html" class="mw-redirect"
        title="Open_Engineering_Consortium">Open Engineering Consortium</a>
        (OEC) created a cluster of small settlements on the north side of the
        Valles Marineris with a sophisticated transportation network connecting
        them, allowing logistic distribution between the small settlments
        and eventually the three colonies.

          Founding

      </h3>
      <p>
        The Martian government was originally founded in 2042 in order to coordinate
        logistics and eventually manage policy between the various colonies.
        They quickly established laws such as the
        <a href="#Committee_for_Advanced_Research_and_Development_Act" class="mw-redirect"
        title="Committee_for_Advanced_Research_and_Development_Act">
          Committee for Advanced Research and Development Act
        </a>

        and the slightly controversial
        <a href="#Factual_and_Theoretic_Information_Act" class="mw-redirect"
        title="Factual_and_Theoretic_Information_Act">
          Factual and Theoretic Information Act
        </a>
        which serves to ensure the verifiability of information presented in public.
        After the government was officially established, it was decided that they
        would take on a system of voting for representatives from each District directly,
        removing the need for parties and heads of state. This meant that politicians
        had the incentive to better serve their constituents and were often recognized
        and well-liked figures in their communities.

        <span class="mw-headline" id="Moneyless_economy">
          Introduction of the moneyless economy
        </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        There is no currency in circulation on Mars, which often surprises
        first-time visitors. In 2043, the Martian government held a referendum
        to determine how the economy would function, since they now had to
        contend with making policy for an undetermined number of future generations.
        Intially, most of the public was split between supporting an economy based
        on a strong well-fare state, similar to that of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"
        title="Finland">Finland</a>,
        or a mild capitalist economy like that which existed in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"
        title="Canada">Canada</a>.
        In the midst of the discussion, an idea, which remains for many Earth-countries,
        revolutionary. Niilo J&auml;rvinen, Finnish psychologist and political idealist,
        suggested that they should not have any economy at all, at least not one based
        on currency. Initially he was challenged to present evidence that such a state
        could exist at all, to which he argued the Martian society at the time was
        already sufficient evidence; they had no money because they were too concerned
        with building infrastructure and doing research to advance science and more
        fundamentally, to stay alive. The more difficult challenge was to provide
        reasoning that such an economy could continue to exist. J&auml;rvinen
        reasoned that people with a high quality of life would work of their own accord;
        he understood the power of boredom and that when people who are well-educated
        get sufficiently bored, in order to aleviate that boredom, they will naturally
        become productive. So much of how a human assigns meaning to their life depends
        on the work that they do. He extended this reasoning to say that school should
        not prevent any student from participating in any program at any level unless
        they require some previous skills or understanding (which was later implemented
        in the
        <a href="#Education_Act"
        title="Education_Act">Education Act</a>). J&auml;rvinen lead to the high status
        of psychologists in Martian society today, as well as much of current Martian
        policy.

          Involvement in World War III

      </h3>
      <p>
        Mars had a minor physical involvement in the Third World War, but the
        government was able to, with much negociation, to convince Russia to
        remove itself from combat and seek a diplomatic solution with NATO,
        effectively ending the entire conflict. The fighting led to a massive
        push within Martian society to create a place where violence is virtually
        impossible and entirely unthinkable. This culminated in the
        <a href="#Martian_Criminal_Justice"
        title="Martian_Criminal_Justice">Martian Criminal Justice</a> policy,
        whose ultimate goal is not necessarily to minimize criminal recitivism,
        but to identify societal biases. In the second decade of the 21st century,
        some legal systems began using learning algorithms to determine the
        probability of someone commiting a crime, or their risk of reoffence.
        These algorithms picked up the biases they were intended to neutralize.
        Martians, then, took these algorithms and reverse-engineered them to
        understand what parts of a person's record made them likely to be
        flagged as a risk, allowing them to identify and address societal
        problems with astonishing effectiveness. This system is still used as
        a standard procedure on Mars today.

        Mars in unusual among nations for many reasons, but one of particular
        interest is the integration of machines as citizens. The Martian government
        recognizes artificial citizens to the extent of all rights and freedoms they
        request in order to prevent the potential issue of enslavement of
        machines which are of sufficient complexity to be unsatisfied with their
        condition and that of being in a legal position where all autonomous
        systems cannot perform work without consent, which they may not have
        the capacity to provide. Taking the example of a system for processing
        nuclear waste, an unpleasant process for humans which is usually outsourced
        to robots with minimal intelligence capable of dealing with changing
        topologies and computing radiation concentrations but not able to
        understand what is doing or performing self-reflection. Were it illegal
        to use robots without their consent, these would be unusable because they
        do not have a large enough mental capacity to provide it. Were it
        legal to require robots to work unconditionally, a more intelligent
        machine could be put to this task which has the ability to comprehend
        the unpleasantness of the job or to express claustrophobia, but with no
        way to improve their condition. A number of government officials have been
        quoted as using the phrase "[this policy] strikes a happy medium."

        regions during and with highs of 35&#8451; in equatorial summer. Its atmosphere
        consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide and only has a pressure of 660Pa
        which is only about 0.6% of the Earths, meaning that it is both extremely
        toxic to humans while also being so thin that it is unbreathable.
        The large carbon content has been extemely beneficial to the greenhouses
        on the planet.

        Mars had large quantities of water approximately three billion years ago,
        with one ocean in the North believed to have covered a third of the entire
        planet, but due to the planet's small size, it radiated its internal heat
        away very quickly on a geological timescale, becoming cold and geologically
        dead. The surface water either froze, forming the large polar ice caps
        and sub-surface permafrost, or evaporated away in the low pressure.

          Government and politics

      </h2>
      <p>
        Mars has a representative democratic government in the context
        of civil service. The Martian government is void of parties and
        heads of state, instead opting for a framework where politicians
        themselves have little power outside of the parliament. Members
        of parliament do not seek fame or recognition, preferring to
        satisfy their constituents. This arises from the structure of
        the District, wherein representatives run directly for election
        and are well known by their community. As a consequence of this,
        they must satisfy their constituents if they wish to remain in office
        as if the District a politician represents is unsatisfied, that
        politician simply won't be elected.

      </h3>
      <p>
        Mars has a number of revered laws which many other nations have
        attempted to implement, however the inertia of monolithic political
        systems has lead to minimal success. Martians are uniquely gifted
        in having a high degree of freedom with enacting or modifying laws
        due to the youth of their establishments.

          Committee for Advanced Research and Development Act
        </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
        This law puts a committee in place which manages the administration
        of officially recognized institutions and organizations devoted to
        higher learning, the advancement of science, and the development of
        new technologies. This committee is very powerful in the Martian
        society but is itself subject to many constraints in order to minimize
        the potential risk of concentrating such power in a group of
        administrators elected by the faculty of an organization and not
        the general population.

      </h4>
      <p>
        The Factual and Theoretic Information Act has been criticized by many
        Earth-faring far-left activists as limiting free speech, but the Martians
        maintain that it is much more benign than it is portrayed. Its goal is
        to ensure the verifiability of information presented as fact or theory in
        a public space. It defines Facts and Theories, as well as giving citizens
        the power to call upon a special Board to investigate scientifically the
        claims of an individual in public. Any person may say anything, but it
        is required that they specify the scope of their understanding. For example,
        in the case of a religion, any person may say they believe in God, however
        they must preface their statement with the stance of belief. In this case,
        they are perfectly free to say whatever they wish, but if they should
        preach their religion as absolute fact, then they become liable to investigation.

          Education Act

      </h4>
      <p>
        The Martian Education Act serves to ensure the granting of an education
        of excellent quality to every Martian citizen. Any person may enter any
        program at any time, and the only tests administered are to check for
        prior required knowledge for a course, and may not be conducted for any
        other purpose. The system has been so successful in recent years that
        Martians at the age of fifteen years will regularly perform at par to or
        better than undergraduate students enrolled in the top universities on
        Earth.

      </h4>
      <p>
        Criminal justice on Mars falls under the jurisdiction of the Committee
        for Advanced Research and Development where psychotherapy is prescribed based
        on the judgement of a tribunal of psychologists assembled by the Committee
        for as long as the tribunal sees fit. Somewhat controversially, the tribunal
        can also prescribe medical intervention in the case of a diagnosable
        neurological disorder, which causes violent tendencies or lack of empathy.
